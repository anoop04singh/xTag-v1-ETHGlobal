## 1. Welcome to xTag!

Welcome! xTag is an intelligent assistant that can perform tasks for you that require on-chain payments, like fetching premium data from protected sources. This guide will walk you through how to use its features.

## 2. Getting Started: Logging In

Your journey begins with a simple and secure login process using an NFC tag.

### Step 1: Scan Your NFC Tag
-   Click the **"Scan NFC Tag"** button.
-   If you're on a compatible mobile device (like Android with Chrome), your phone will ask you to hold your NFC tag near the back of your device.
-   The app will automatically read the tag's ID and log you in.

### Alternative: Manual Login
If you can't scan the tag, you can type its unique ID into the text box and click **"Continue"**.

Upon your first login, xTag automatically creates and securely stores a new cryptocurrency wallet for you. This wallet is what your AI assistant will use to pay for services on your behalf.

## 3. The Main Interface

Once logged in, you'll see three main sections:

-   **Sidebar (Left):** Here you can see your **Wallet Info**, including your wallet address and token balances. You can also log out from here.
-   **Header (Top):** Switch between the three main views: **Chat**, **Explore**, and **About**.
-   **Main Pane (Center):** This is where you'll interact with the AI, explore available commands, or read about the project.

## 4. Interacting with Your AI Assistant

The **Chat** view is where the magic happens. You can talk to the AI in plain English. When you ask for something that requires a paid service, the AI will follow a simple, transparent process.

### How Paid Requests Work: A Step-by-Step Example

Let's say you want to get the latest crypto trading signals.

**Step 1: Make a Request**
You start by asking the AI a question, just like you would with any other chatbot.

> **You:** "Show me the latest crypto trading signals"

**Step 2: Get a Confirmation Prompt**
The AI understands your request corresponds to a paid service. It will ask for your permission and clearly state the cost before doing anything.

> **AI:** "I can fetch the latest cryptocurrency trading signals for you. This action costs 0.10 USDC. Would you like me to proceed?"
>
> `[Yes, run "trading-signals"]` *(This appears as a clickable button)*

**Step 3: Authorize the Action**
Click the **"Yes, run..."** button. This tells the AI that you approve the action and the associated cost.

**Step 4: Receive Your Data**
The AI assistant will now securely handle the payment in the background and fetch the data for you. The final result is then displayed in the chat.

> **AI:** "âœ… **Successfully fetched data from "trading-signals"**
>
> **Latest Trading Signals:**
> - ðŸŸ¢ **BTC/USD**: BUY at 68500.50 (Confidence: 0.92)
> - ðŸ”´ **ETH/USD**: SELL at 3500.75 (Confidence: 0.88)
>
> ---
> **Payment Details:**
> *Transaction Hash:* [0x123...abc](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/tx/0x123...abc)"

## 5. Available Commands
